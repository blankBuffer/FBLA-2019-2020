Game requires Java version 11 to run. Any lower will return error
Game runs on Mac and Linux (Both work but different Linux distributions may behave strangely with rendering window)

Higher Me:
    to run the game type these either of these commands in the Linux or Mac terminal.
    Set your directory to FBLA
    "bash run"
    or
    "java -cp bin game.Game"
    or on Mac simply click on the app

    if it does not run because of permissions try
    "sudo bash run"
    If you get run-time error you don't have latest java version.
    
    Game could crash (Not likely) . I apologize

DO NOT COPY or MODIFY any files within FBLA folder, only to be viewed or run.

    beware that I don't use many comments in code.

The whole game and all code was written by Benjamin Robert Currie
    some small stack Overflow snippets of code less than 10 lines were used Mostly in Audio and In frame timing
    Game name suggested by my Mother

Programs used for making game:

    Eclipse java IDE
    Gimp
    Garage-band (Mac Version)
   
My spellings/Grammar may be incorrect in code and any text and I don't care.
